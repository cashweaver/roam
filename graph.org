In mathematics, and more specifically in [[id:5bc61709-6612-4287-921f-3e2509bd2261][Graph Theory]], a graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related". The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called [[id:1b2526af-676d-4c0f-aa85-1ba05b8e7a93][Vertices]] (also called nodes or points) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an [[id:7211246e-d3da-491e-a493-e84ba820e63f][Edge]] (also called link or line).
