Abbreviations, initialisms, and other short-forms can be can confuse those without context. [[id:fd00fbf2-6b65-442f-90b9-b9d5d64a5fde][Be explicit]] to avoid such confusion:

1. Use the long-form once, followed by the abbreviation in parenthesis, then use the short-form.

   #+begin_quote
   Arrakis, also known as (AKA) Dune, is the desert world at the center of the Dune series by [[id:7f3c7b18-3173-4c69-a4c5-b7d33630ae85][Frank Herbert]].

   ...

   Leto Atreides the Second, aka God-Emperor, ...
   #+end_quote

2. Provide context around the short-form. E.g. a link, footnote, [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr][HTML abbr tag]], etc.

   #+begin_quote
   Arrakis, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aka][AKA]] Dune, is the desert world at the center of the Dune series by [[id:7f3c7b18-3173-4c69-a4c5-b7d33630ae85][Frank Herbert]].
   #+end_quote

3. Avoid the short-form. Instead, use the long-form exclusively.

   Arrakis, also known as Dune, is the desert world at the center of the Dune series by [[id:7f3c7b18-3173-4c69-a4c5-b7d33630ae85][Frank Herbert]].
