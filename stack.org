In computer science, a stack is an [[id:2eae74ba-4003-45cf-8425-7291aaa7a537][Abstract data type]] that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:

1. Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
2. Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.
