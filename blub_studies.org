Blub studies are the "mundane, ultra-specific-seeming knowledge" [cite:@kuhnDefenseBlubStudies] underlying something. It's the "fiddly technical details" [cite:@kuhnDefenseBlubStudies]. "There's a seemingly infinite amount of it, full of bespoke details for you to stumble over, and that makes it, often, unbelievably frustrating" [cite:@kuhnDefenseBlubStudies].
