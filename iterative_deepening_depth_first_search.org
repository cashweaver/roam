In computer science, iterative deepening search or more specifically iterative deepening depth-first search[2] (IDS or IDDFS) is a state space/graph search strategy in which a depth-limited version of [[id:81c88eaa-3ec9-486c-bcdf-457dd40b4eba][Depth-first search]] search is run repeatedly with increasing depth limits until the goal is found. IDDFS is optimal like [[id:cff4f06c-6179-423d-aa1d-ba54d85615e2][Breadth-first search]], but uses much less memory; at each iteration, it visits the nodes in the search tree in the same order as depth-first search, but the cumulative order in which nodes are first visited is effectively breadth-first.

*** Description
- A modified version of [[id:81c88eaa-3ec9-486c-bcdf-457dd40b4eba][Depth-first search]] which is depth-limited and slowly expands its depth.
- Has a lower memory requirement than [[id:cff4f06c-6179-423d-aa1d-ba54d85615e2][Breadth-first search]]
