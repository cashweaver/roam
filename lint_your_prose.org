You should use a [[id:bb5a1f30-1733-41b5-9c34-bcac7f8cb701][linter]] to analyze your prose.

I use prose linters to:

1. ensure that I write with a consistent [[id:05911fff-a79b-4462-bf6d-a3cec4e1c9f2][style]]
2. catch spelling mistakes

I prefer [[github:amperser/proselint][proselint]] because it includes rules that I already try to follow. There's also [[github:textlint/textlint][textlint]] if you're interested in specifying your own rules.
