A term used to justify ridiculous, pointless and occasionally gratuitous behaviour.

[cite:@Lulz]
#+end_quote

This can be the end of it; doing something innocuous or mildly annoying to get a rise from someone. However, it can also be a [[id:fc5f16e4-8918-4b5c-bc8b-4a4a10d837ff][dog whistle]] for worse behaviors.

Saying you've "done it for the lulz" can communicate two things to two different groups:

1. To those outside your group: I was kidding! Can't you take a joke? It's not serious. Etc.
2. To those in your group: I'm serious. It's hilarious that anyone would think I was kidding.
