The purpose of this =README= is to explain some of the details in this collection of content. In no particular order:

- I haven't "written" all of the posts. I employ liberal use of quoting as a way of [[id:01fdcfa8-d1dd-420a-a473-b8ac112d7b2f][archiving]].
- I use tags prefixed with =@= to identify original authors (eg: [[/tags/cashweaver][@cashweaver]]).
- When PostA links to PostB, then a backlink to PostA will appear at the bottom of PostB ([[id:01fdcfa8-d1dd-420a-a473-b8ac112d7b2f][example]]).
- I often omit the source of a quote if there is only once source used in the entire post. You'll find that source mentioned just below the title after "References".
