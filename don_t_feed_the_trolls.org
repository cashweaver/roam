Trolls seek to derail conversations, inject negativity, and generally be a nuisance [[id:54072a82-9f61-443d-b51e-af74fc18e895][for the lulz]]. How do you deal with them? How do you refute their bullshit or drive them out of your communities? Ignore them. Their goal is attention -- don't give it to them.
