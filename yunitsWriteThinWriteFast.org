* Summary

#+begin_quote
Set your editor's column width very low ... 36 characters for me, [your mileage may vary].
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
Thinner columns help you read faster. Writing speed is dominated by reading speed. If you read faster, you write faster.
#+end_quote

* Thoughts

I've seem content width discussed often when it comes to reading. A width of 72 characters comes to mind, though I'm not sure where I picked that up. I haven't seen content width discussed as often when it comes to writing. That said, there are tools provided within, or as addons for, text editors (like [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/modules/ui/zen/README.org][zen for Doom Emacs]]) which constrict the writing space.
