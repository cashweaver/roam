* Summary

[[id:3657474e-5e72-4f19-8664-c66583f6310d][You're more likely to hear things you agree with or that are, broadly speaking, aligned with your world-view]]. Therefore, you're likely to over-index on a certain flavor of advice. You may benefit from considering the reverse of the piece of advice.

* Thoughts

A simple bit of [[id:efe31d96-34a6-439a-a34d-fdff9df0e51a][metacognitive]] advice which I'd like to integrate into my daily life.

It's much easier to join a group that celebrates your natural proclivities than one that demands you fight against them.

I wonder whether everyone would be better off if they automatically reversed any tempting advice that they heard (except feedback directed at them personally). Whenever they read an inspirational figure saying "take more risks", they interpret it as "I seem to be looking for advice telling me to take more risks; that fact itself means I am probably risk-seeking and need to be more careful". Whenever they read someone telling them about the obesity crisis, they interpret it as "I seem to be in a very health-conscious community; maybe I should worry about my weight less."

Probably this wouldn't literally work as written. Too much advice is applicable to everybody; the absence of advice to play more Russian roulette is directly linked to Russian roulette being a really bad idea for pretty much everyone.

The checklist could be something like:

1. Are there plausibly near-equal groups of people who need this advice versus the opposite advice?
2. Have you self-selected into the group of people receiving this advice by, for example, being a fan of the blog / magazine / TV channel / political party / self-help-movement offering it?
3. Then maybe the opposite advice, for you in particular, is at least as worthy of consideration.
