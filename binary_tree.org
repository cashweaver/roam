In computer science, a binary tree is a tree [[[id:1a068ad5-3e16-4ec4-b238-6fdc5904aeb4][Tree]]] data structure [[[id:738c2ba7-a272-417d-9b6d-b6952d765280][Data structure]]] in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.

#+begin_quote
A full binary tree (sometimes referred to as a proper or plane or strict binary tree) is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.

** Perfect binary tree

#+begin_quote
A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level.

#+begin_quote
A balanced binary tree is a binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

:END:

#+begin_quote
A degenerate (or pathological) tree is where each parent node has only one associated child node. This means that the tree will behave like a linked list data structure.

** Skewed binary tree
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4c7bf5db-dc29-44a1-bb77-36d560b38688
:END:

#+begin_quote
A skewed binary tree is a pathological/degenerate tree in which the tree is either dominated by the left nodes or the right nodes. Thus, there are two types of skewed binary tree: left-skewed binary tree and right-skewed binary tree.
