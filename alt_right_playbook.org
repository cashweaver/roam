The Alt-right Playbook is a series produced by [[id:2e66d444-9a3a-4ed3-8fac-210bb61933fb][Ian Danskin]] which discusses rhetorical techniques employed by the alt-right. It's primary focus is on building a common language to describe patterns he, and others, observe in the alt-right.

While [[id:2e66d444-9a3a-4ed3-8fac-210bb61933fb][Danskin]] hasn't formally proposed solutions or a counter-playbook, I have extracted some ideas from the Alt-right Playbook:

- [[id:246566c2-5b4b-479a-9e1d-522fd85903d9][Speak directly to your audience]]; don't validate terrible ideas by platforming them to your audience or by debating/etc
- [[id:91aae608-44c7-4dd0-94e1-512d5d5263cf][Imagine others complexly]]
- [[id:c0564758-b90d-42a6-be58-44d8985330ad][Pursue egalitarian policies and structures of governance]]
- Prefer the [[id:9aade3e8-6ddb-475d-b31f-6e5dccee15a3][Duck test]] to believing people at their word
