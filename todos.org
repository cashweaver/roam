* TODO [#2] Node idea: Akido/etc as a metaphor for redirecting unhelpful thoughts. "I must be productive at all times" can become helpful by redefining what it means to be productive and the types of activities which are productive.

* TODO [#2] Acting in line with my values requires occassional disagreement or broaching uncomfortable topics or cutting people out of my life. I have found those actions to be worthwhile in 100% of cases.
:PROPERTIES:
:Created: [2022-02-14 Mon 09:10]
:END:
* TODO [#2] Node idea: Try to proactively solve problems; fix things before they're even problems. Avoid war by removing the conditions that give rise to war.

:PROPERTIES:
:Created: [2022-02-14 Mon 10:20]
:END:
* TODO [#2] Node idea: Overall workflow for roam notes is to have individual ideas that build up connections over time. These connections form groups from which synthesized ideas can be extracted. The roam notes aren't meant to be read by others on their own -- other should start with the synthesis.
:PROPERTIES:
:Created: [2022-02-14 Mon 10:36]

* TODO [#2] Node idea: Be curious; implies a growth mindset; implies humbleness and "I don't know everything"; required careful listening and attention rather than "waiting for you to finish so I can say my thing"

* TODO [#2] Node idea: Don't go back to sleep (https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-after-the-pandemic-we-can-t-go-back-to-sleep); Learn from experiences and don't just revert to prior behaviors

:PROPERTIES:
:Created: [2022-02-14 Mon 12:27]
:END:
* TODO [#2] Node idea: Focus on topics/areas for some amount of time; analogous to multi-tasking. Don't read a lisp article, then a farming article, then a political article (or books, etc). Dive into lisp for a little while, say a week of focus, summarize what you've taken away, then move to another topic. Work to synthesize later. :idea:
:PROPERTIES:
:Created: [2022-02-14 Mon 12:30]
:END:
* TODO [#2] Node idea: You think the way you practice. To think with a long term perspective it isn't sufficient to know a long term perspective exists -- you must cultivate a regular practice of long term thinking. Perhaps take up bonsai or another hobby/etc which forces a long term perspective.
