The unexamined life is not worth living, [[https://youtu.be/l2kN7pEME4o?t=51][man]].

These are vague goals, in no particular order, for myself in 2021. I think it would be helpful to break them down into shorter-term and specific goals. That'll come later. For now...

- Give more time to the people in my life. Keep in touch with friends.
- Learn my [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/c8EeJtqnsKyXdLtc5/how-long-can-people-usefully-work][working limit]] and respect it.
- Become more comfortable [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25482927][sitting quietly in a room alone]].
- Notice the [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KwdcMts8P8hacqwrX/noticing-the-taste-of-lotus][taste of lotus]]; live intentionally.
- Use a [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TyswYDeub7mxMXCgi/the-monthly-newsletter-as-thinking-tool][newsletter]], or similar, and [[https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CAZJXP_enUS900&sxsrf=ALeKk018Uxd8MrGMD408ZNQF-K2ojSC2kA%3A1609550898080&ei=MszvX8auBI73-gTq8L_IBg&q=writing+thinking+tool&oq=writing+thinking+tool&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQDFAAWABggc0GaABwAXgAgAEAiAEAkgEAmAEAqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjGj5ysjPztAhWOu54KHWr4D2kQ4dUDCA4][writing]] as thinking tools.
- [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24259861][Document what I do as if I was describing it to a stranger]].
- Manage my [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aDtzAZf3LnwYvmBP7/attention-is-your-scarcest-resource][attention]].
- Write, at least a little bit, about what I read.
- Read more.
- Keep a [[http://www.zotero.org][personal archive]] of what I've read.
- [[https://apps.ankiweb.net/][Remember]] what I've learned.
- Continue [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25595583][studying math]] and, eventually, ML/AI.
- Continue [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y0rATMeou3hKTt7yDgbNwvtOitZSVFEbjeZBH3AZ5Gs/edit?usp=sharing][lifting]] and working out generally.
