#+title: Fallacy of Gray

The fallacy of gray is an assertion, in the face of a lack of a clear black and white divide, that the cases are all equally good or bad. The fallacy is that (to continue the color metaphor) each case is a different /shade/ of gray; that some cases are better (for some definition of better) than others.
