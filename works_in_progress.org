A collection of work-in-progress posts. I will eventually extract these into individual nodes.

* Components of Software Project Planning

** TODO Identify and Explicitly Define the Problem

- Perhaps the most important part
- Define the solution you seek to solve. Your project is a success if it addresses the points you list here.

** TODO Understand the History and Surroundings

Projects are rarely greenfield. Consider the history of projects which came before and the context in which your project exists.

** TODO Dependencies

Understand how your work will depend on external services.

- Do those services have capacity to support your project?
- What will you do if one of your dependencies fails?

** TODO Technical Debt

- Is there pre-existing technical debt?
- What, if any, technical debt will this project introduce?
  - What is your plan, and timeline, for mitigation and/or remediation?

** TODO Estimates

- Timeline estimate
- Effort estimate

** TODO Security

** TODO Reliability

** TODO Data Integrity

** TODO Privacy

** TODO Scalability

** TODO Latency

** TODO Abuse

** TODO Accessibility

** TODO Alternative Methods

- Assume there is more than one way to complete your project. Resist the pull of your first idea. Think critically and document alternative approaches to solving the underlying problem

** TODO Have a Plan for ...

*** TODO Launch

- How will you launch your project?

*** TODO Testing
*** TODO Documentation

- How will you document your project? At minimum you should have a document which describes the goals, etc (see below).

* Software Project Planning Principles

1. It doesn't exist unless you can measure it.
   - Your feature isn't "live" unless you have a metric/heartbeat/etc which indicates as such.
