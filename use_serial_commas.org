#+begin_quote
[...] a serial comma (also called a series comma, Oxford comma, or Harvard comma) is a comma placed immediately after the penultimate term (i.e., before the coordinating conjunction, such as and or or) in a series of three or more terms.

[cite:@SerialComma2022]

Examples:

- Incorrect: "To my parents, Abraham Lincoln and God."
- *Correct*: "To my parents, Abraham Lincoln, and God."

Note that serial commas are not a fix-all for ambigious sentences. They may, in fact, /introduce/ ambiguity [cite:@SerialComma2022].
