- Documentation is good when, and only when, it is also discoverable
- Your documentation is discoverable when it exists where your audience goes when they are looking for it
  - Commit messages often not indexed in search engines (external or internal)
  - Agree with "most" that including the raw error message is fantastic; increases precise searchability
  - The commit message referenced in "most" is fantastic documentation (agree with all points made); however, it isn't as discoverable as it could be.
    - Better to write the documentation in a more accessible place and link to it (or even copy/paste it so long as you also include the link) in the commit message
  - Agree with "least" that commit messages are not the most discoverable place
  - Agree with "least" that tests /are/ ([[id:dea093d4-ed58-42d7-b8a6-63acfa291676][S-tier]]) documentation
